remo# Next.js Streaming API with FastAPI

## Overview
This project is a full-stack application that combines a Next.js frontend with a FastAPI backend. The frontend is built using React and Next.js, while the backend is developed using Python and FastAPI.

## Backend Setup

### Requirements
To run the FastAPI backend, you need to have Python 3.7 or higher installed. You will also need to install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Installation
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Backend
To start the FastAPI server, run the following command:
```
uvicorn api.index:app --reload
```
This will start the server in development mode, allowing for automatic reloads on code changes.

### API Endpoints
The backend provides various API endpoints. Refer to the `index.py` file in the `api` directory for details on the available endpoints and their usage.

## Frontend Setup

### Installation
To set up the Next.js frontend, navigate to the frontend directory:
```
cd frontend
```

Then, install the required npm packages:
```
npm install
```

### Running the Frontend
To start the Next.js development server, run:
```
npm run dev
```
This will start the frontend application, which can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can interact with the application by navigating to the frontend URL in your web browser. The frontend will communicate with the backend API to fetch and display data.
